  <p><em>Pizza Margherita, the archetype of pizza</em></p>
  <p>Pizza, who doesn't know pizza? Round flattened dough, topped with tomato sauce, pepperoni, mozzarella and jalape√±os, baked in the oven with a crispy brown crust. I'm lovin' it.</p>
  <p>While I like my pizza spicy, today we'll make a (somewhat) traditional "Pizza Margherita". But feel free to add more toppings to your liking!</p>
  <br>
  <h3>You'll be needing the following ingredients (1 pizza):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Wheat (100g)</li>
    <li>Yeast (1,5g)</li>
    <li>A (small) teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>Water (&plusmn;100ml)</li>
    <li>Tomato sauce (since where going "fast")</li>
    <li>Mozzarella (one ball)</li>
    <li>Some fresh Basil leaves</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Now, let's cook the dish.</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Put the wheat, yeast and the teaspoon of salt into a bowl. Start adding water and knead into a smooth, non-sticking dough ball. Make sure not to add too much water, if you do, add some more wheat again. You'll feel when the kneaded dough is perfect.</li>
    <br>
    <li>When finished kneading, let the dough rest for &plusmn;30 minutes until 1 hour.</li>
    <br>
    <li>If the dough has risen enough, get it out of the bowl onto a floured surface (otherwise you can start again). Knead the dough ball into a flattened, rounded dough bread.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Preheat your oven to 200 degrees, and start topping your pizza bases with tomato sauce and pieces of mozzarella. When your oven is done preheating, put the pizza in the middle of the oven and cook it within 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <br>
    <li>When your pizza is done cooking get it out of the oven, finish it off with the fresh basil leaves, cut it up and dig in.</li>
  </ol>
