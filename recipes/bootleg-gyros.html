    <p><em>Gyros with meat, onions, tomato, lettuce, fried potatoes, and tzatziki rolled in a pita</em></p>
    <p>Gyros is a food dish of Greek origin made from meat cooked on a vertical spit and served wrapped or stuffed in pita bread. Commonly served together with vegetables such as tomato, onion, fried potatoes and topped with tzatziki sauce.</p>
    <p>This "bootleg" version is inspired by this <a href='https://youtu.be/iErqWGwso7o' target='_blank'>video</a>. I've adjusted the ingredients to my personal taste.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>You'll be needing the following ingredients (4 portions):</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken thighs (400g)</li>
      <li>Turkish bread (one whole)</li>
      <li>Lettuce (&plusmn;100g)</li>
      <li>1 garlic</li>
      <li>1 onion</li>
      <li>1 (red) bell pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 a cucumber</li>
      <li>Greek yogurt (500g)</li>
      <li>Feta cheese (50-75g)</li>
      <li>Seasoning to your choice; experiment! (I've used salt, pepper, paprika and curry powder)</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Now, let's cook the dish.</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>We'll be preparing the chicken thighs first, because they need to marinate for at least &plusmn;2 hours beforehand. Cut up the chicken thighs to your size of choice. Cut up 1/2 an onion and 1/2 a garlic. Fill a bowl with 250g (1/2 a cup) Greek yogurt, olive oil, the chopped up onion and garlic and season to taste. How does it taste? Good? Now add the chicken thigh and let rest for &plusmn;2 hours (the longer, the better).</li>
      <br>
      <li>While the chicken thighs or resting, we'll create the (bootleg-)tzatziki sauce. Chop up the other halves of onion and garlic, plus 1/2 of your 1/2 cucumber. Make sure you mince them really fine. Now add them to the other 1/2 of Greek yogurt. Add salt and pepper to taste. <strong>Tip:</strong> add some lime juice for freshness.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Next up, we'll prepare the salad. Chop the remaining cucumber halve, the bell pepper and the lettuce to your size of choice. Serve all together in one bowl.</li>
      <br>
      <li>After a long waiting period, we can finally get cooking. But before we start cooking, preheat your oven to 180 degrees and put your pan with some olive oil on the stove. While both the oven and pan or preheating, get the chicken thigh out of the marinade and make sure to clean off the yogurt as much as possible.</li>
      <br>
      <li>When your oven is done preheating, put the whole Turkish bread in the oven until lightly crisp on the outside. While you've put the bread in the oven, put the cleaned up chicken in your hot pan and cook until nice and brown on the outside.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Your Turkish bread and chicken thighs should be done cooking around the same time. Cut up the bread in quarters and build yourself that hard-earned "bootleg" gyros!</li>
    </ol>
