    <p><em>A bowl of chili con carne served with tortilla chips</em></p>
    <p>Chili con carne (short chili) is a spicy stew containing chili peppers, meat, tomatoes and beans. Other seasonings may include onions, garlic and cumin. It's a dish which originates from northern Mexico/southern Texas.</p>
    <p>Personally, I like to make it extra spicy (read: challenging). But for this recipe, I'll go for the whole package described above.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>You'll be needing the following ingredients (2 portions):</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Minced meat (250g)</li>
      <li>Can of dice tomatoes (400g)</li>
      <li>3 cloves of garlic</li> 
      <li>1 onion</li>
      <li>1 bell pepper</li>
      <li>1 chili pepper</li>
      <li>Can of sweet corn (150g)</li>
      <li>Can of black beans (400g)</li>
      <li>Seasoning: salt, pepper and cumin powder</li>
      <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Now, let's cook the dish.</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>First, let's heat our pan on the stove with some olive oil. Break the minced meat up into bite size pieces and put them in the hot pan. Season with salt, pepper and cumin powder. Cook until brown.</li>
      <br>
      <li>While the meat is cooking, dice your cloves of garlic, onion, bell pepper and chili pepper. Drain and rinse your sweet corn and black beans.</li>
      <br>
      <li>When the meat is done cooking, get it out of the hot pan and set aside. Important note: leave the rendered out fat and juices in the pan as much as possible. Throw in your chopped cloves of garlic, onion, bell pepper, chili pepper, sweet corn and black beans and cook them for a couple of minutes.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Now let the cooked meat back into the party and cook for a couple of minutes more.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Then, for the final step: add the diced tomatoes (don't drain them) to the pan and bring down to a simmer for &plusmn;30 minutes until ready to serve. Season to taste. <strong>Tip:</strong> add some sour cream when served.</li>
    </ol>
